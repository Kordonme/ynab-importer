# Nordea Transaction Importer for YNAB

The goal of this project is to make it as easy and smooth as possible to import transactions from Nordea netbank to YNAB.

# Getting started

Visit the [website](https://ynab-importer-eight.vercel.app/). There are two pieces of information required to import transactions:

1. Your YNAB Personal Access Token (PAT)
2. Transactions from Nordea netbank

## Obtain a PAT

1. Visit the [YNAB Developer settings](https://app.youneedabudget.com/settings/developer) page.
2. Click the "New Token" and save it. It won't be shown again!

## Transactions

Use your mouse to select the transactions you want to import. Copy the text from the table and paste it into the "Input from Nordea" field.

## Import

Verify that the balance from netbank matches the balance shown in the transaction list.

Hit the import button to import the transactions.
